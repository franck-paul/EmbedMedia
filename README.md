# EmbedMedia

Plugin for Dotclear 2

Embed externial media in entry using the oEmbed API (see <https://oembed.com/>)

> oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites. The simple API allows a website to display embedded content (such as photos or videos) when a user posts a link to that resource, without having to parse the resource directly. (<https://oembed.com/>)

## Technical information

A predefined list of oEmbed API (Youtube, Vimeo, Flickr, â€¦) is used if possible before trying to discover the oEmbed API entrypoint from the given media URL response.

Note: Intended to replace externalMedia Dotclear 2 plugin, which now requires a paid API key.
